    - _RC Owners and Residents:_ View read-only information and construction status.
2. **Secure Government Authentication:**
    - Authentication is conducted through a secure, government-provided service to verify identities and prevent impersonation.
3. **Visual Progress Tracking:**
    - _Icogram:_ Modular vector graphics that visually represent construction stages.
    - _Gantt-like Timeline:_ Diagram for visualizing project phase durations and dependencies.
